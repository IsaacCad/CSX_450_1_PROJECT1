Set up machine in amazon the T2
2) Look at existing instances 
Click on descriptions â†’ copy the ip
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh      # curl lets you download from 
Ssl lets your secure hmtl link
Sudo Usermod -aG docker Ubuntu
Logout
//* we are going to use a program called curl.
   Curl downloads files from a web address.
   We are going to give it some flags */
Command : curl -sSL https://get.docker.com # good practice
Command : curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh # bad practice
  // the |sh lets us pipe in a random script into our shell directly. This one lets docker take over the aws instance. Normally you would download and analyse this.
            Next command
sudo usermod -a -G docker ubuntu
Command : sudo usermod -aG dockeR ubuntu // if we dont do this, the everytime we run docker we will have to do SUDU or SUDO
COMMAND : cntrl D disconnects
Command : docker -v (? I think) #   this is supposed to recconect us 
docker
Command : docker pull jupyter/datascience-notebook
Command : docker run -v /home/ubuntu:/home/jovyan -p 8888:8888 -d jupyter/datascience-notebook
     #Jovyan is the user in the jupyter image
    #datascience-notebook is the name of the image
Command docker pull jupyter/datascience-notebook
Command : docker images   # lets you check images
// you could do : docker pull mongo
Command : docker tag jupyter/datascience-notebook dsnb # created an alias for dsnb
     docker tag jupyter/datascience-notebook dsnb
    docker run -v /home/ubuntu:/home/jovyan -p 8888:8888 -d dsnb
Image is a class ( defines an object and what it will be )
The object is the container, the object exists in memory
 Command : docker images # lets us see classes
Command : docker ps # lets us see what is running, what are existing objects
		// docker defines images in reference to other images
Anything we have to get jupyter to do we ask docker to do for us in jupiter. Docker manages jupyter. We dont have to mange the versions. Other people do via jupyter comittee and mange the docker image for the jupiter project.
Sooooo now what can we do
  Lets put in the ip address of our amazon server including the port
http://IPaddres:8888
http://35.163.88.54:8888
We will run docker ps
Then we do docker exec command 
If you get disconnected recconect 
Then to get the token do 
	Command: docker ps
		Grab the container ID , which looks like b7ed
      Command docker exec b7ed jupyter notebook list
If you get disconnected recconect 
Then to get the token do 
	Command: docker ps
		Grab the container ID , which looks like b7ed
      Command docker exec b7ed jupyter notebook list
